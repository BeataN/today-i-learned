# Contributing Guidelines

We created this 'Today I Learned' project to accompany a mentoring initiative for female and minority developers.

For this reason, we are not currently accepting pull requests unless they are from a participant in our mentoring programme.

We hope in future to have more open source projects that we're able to accept more contributions to.

**If you are not a participant in our mentoring programme:**

* Thank you for your interest!
* Feel free to follow us on Twitter [@no_mayo_digital](https://twitter.com/no_mayo_digital) and perhaps send us a tweet to say hi - we 

**If you are a participant in our mentoring programme, the following guidelines will help you make your contribution to the project.**

1. You'll need a GitHub account of your own, if you don't have one already (login/register [here](https://github.com/login))
2. Once you're logged into GitHub, you can view the [Today I Learned](https://github.com/no-mayo/today-i-learned) repository and click the 'Fork' button at the top to create a copy of the repository in your own account
3. While viewing your own copy of 'Today I Learned', you can follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to clone the project to your computer for local development and get it running as per the instructions in the project's README.md file
4. To choose an issue to work on, return to the No Mayo project repo ([here](https://github.com/no-mayo/today-i-learned)) and click on the 'Issues' tab to browse the currently-open issues
5. It's very likely that you'll want to ask questions and find out additional information about an issue before tackling it - and as we'll be working with you in person during your Mayo Morning session, we'll be on hand to answer all of your questions
6. Once you've chosen an issue to tackle, you can post in that issue's thread that you've claimed the issue and are beginning work on it
7. In your local project, create a new branch for the issue/feature/topic that you're tackling, being sure to use a descriptive branch name e.g. `git checkout -b fix-spelling-errors`
8. Make the code changes in your local project to resolve the issue that you're tackling
9. When ready, `git commit -am [succinct but descriptive explanation]` and `git push` so that your changes are stored in the new branch in your fork of the project (you can repeat this step with several small commits if needed 
10. When you're ready to request that your code be pulled into the main project, first view your fork of the project on GitHub and select your issue branch from the 'Branches' dropdown menu
11. From this branch, you can click the 'Pull Request' button to be taken to the pull request form - here, it's helpful to include in the comment box a link to the issue that your pull request is addressing, as well as perhaps a brief outline of the code changes that your pull request contains
12. When ready, submit your pull request for us to review and accept
13. Celebrate!

**Additional notes:**

* If you come across a new issue while you're working on an existing one, please feel free to propose that a new issue be created in the project
* This app doesn't yet have any automated tests to run, which we hope to remedy very soon
